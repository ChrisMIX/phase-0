<!--
What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?

It is important to know the file path as well as the proper syntax for your specific document.


What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?

I played around with the alignment and text size to get the positioning right. Some of the finer details needed were difficult to achieve, like editing the specific letters and adding line breaks.


What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)

I used specific tags relating to the sections I wanted to edit. If something was inside a div tag, I used div to specify that section. I also used parent child selectors to further specify which text I wanted to edit. The more specific I was, the better.


Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you chose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?

I attempted to use classes, though they did not work as planned. I feel as if classes would function better based on the fact that they can be used multple times in code.


When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?

I think the actual site had some better optimization in the code, knowing that some options I used were restricted to the CSS solution. Also I feel as if there are other tags or tools used in the source code of the site that I have not encountered as of yet.
