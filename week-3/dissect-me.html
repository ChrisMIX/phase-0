  <p>
    Version control is a great resource that allows you to monitor every version of a project at each stage of the creation process. If something goes wrong down the line, you are able to revert to a previous version and try again, versus taking a longer amount of time struggling to address the issues.

  Git helps to keep track of changes through the use of branches. You create your own iterations of the main file and add various changes until you are satisfied with the fully funcional results. Git lets you know when the master file is out of date compared to the various branches and it allows you to merge them into one branch once changes area finalized.

<p>
  Github is a great place to store code because anyone can access it. Github stores your files and branches in an online resource, similar to that of Dropbox. At this point anyone you choose can access it and provide their own changes, which are also monitored and noted in branches from the main file. Ultimately, github is convenient in facilitating partner projects and promoting collaboration without the fear of someone ruining the main file you are working on.

<!--
What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

The tags I used in this challenge were header and article. The ones I use most would be the header and footer tags, because in my head they make the most sense on a conceptual level. The header is always the top or first part of a webpage, and the footer the last.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

Browser elements are laid out based on the tags and there inherent differences. The browser displays in the following order: header, nav, section, article, and footer.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I learned that sublime can be customized to your own personal preference and how you like to code. I think I will create snippets once I understand my own coding habits better and get a better feel for how snippets work. I'm always open tp researching new things, and seeing exactly what shortcuts I acn already use definitely fits under that.
