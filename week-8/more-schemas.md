**What is a one-to-one database?**

A one to one relationship is when two things only link to each other. An example is a serial number and a product.

**When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).**

You would use a one to one database when you want each item to have a unique tag you can refer to it by.

**What is a many-to-many database?**

When two types of items aren't limited to just one of the other category. Ex: Ingredients can be in many sandwiches, and sandwiches can have many ingredients.

**When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).**

You want to use a many to many database if you want to utilize items multiple times or classify them in multiple ways.

Knowing proper examples where they would apply is tough, especially when you can potentially link them togeter.
