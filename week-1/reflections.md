1.1 Think About Time Reflection

What I chose to look at was the videos about creating a habit as well as tiny habits. Both videos suggest associating the activity or task you want to become a habit with something you already do  or enjoy. The end result would be that eventually you create strong habits and learn their benefits. For example, in the creating habits video they mention eating chocolate before going to the gym to motivate you, until eventually going to the gym becomes a self sustained activity. I also checked the articles about timeboxing and getting in the zone. Timeboxing is an idea that has you setting a predetermined time to work and then stopping at the end to evaluate what was accomplished and discuss productivity. In Phase 0, I can set smaller amounts of time to work on an assignment and decide afterwards if I should continue with the assignment or move on based on my self evaluation. It really helps to utilize time well and prevent you from wasting time on something that may have you stuck. Currently I manage my time with limited success I would say. I try to set a schedule for myself a lot of the time that will often get ignored in favor of doing something else. I know that I just need to have better discipline with it, and the ideas here would definitely help me to stay on track as well as productive. My current strategy does work to an extent, but I waste a lot more time than I should be. Down the line in this program I know I may not have the luxury of a lot of time, which is why I need to make the change. I will definitely explore timeboxing to make sure I utilize time effectively by setting smaller amounts of time to work and also evaluate my results or progress. A reward system is definitely something I can use to my advantage, since like everyone I have those "weaknesses" that I fall prey to instead of working. My overall strategy for time management in Phase 0 is to take it day by day. I need to make sure I have done a satisfactory amount of work in each day in order to stay on pace. Aside from that, it really just consists of using the ideas I learned here to a much greater extent.

1.2 The Command Line Reflection

1-4. Shell is what interprets your commands (in my case it would be terminal on my mac) and bash is the language or script being used within the shell. The challenge for me in this lesson was having a lot of new jargon being thrown at me at one time. Some of the more complicated commands that don't have specific names like >, <, and | threw me for a loop. The command line is also fairly intimidating, especially when I get an error for directions from the lesson. As far as my success rate goes, I was able to correctly use about 80% of the commands given to me, which I am happy with on a first run through the command line. To me the most important arguments to know are the ones you will be using most frequently like cd, mkdir, pwd, less, cp, and a few others. Some of the other commands have their time and place and will certainly have their purposes, but these commands have more practical use.

5. pwd - print working directory
ls - list directory
mv - move file or directory
cd - change directory
../ - this refers to the directory above the one you are in.
touch -
mkdir - make directory
less - page through a file
rmdir - remove directory
rm - remove file
help - pulls up command list

1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

In order to create a new repository, you simply hit the green new repository button on the home page of github, assuming you signed in already. After that, you will be given a chance to name the repository and make it public or private, amongst other things. You then hit create repository and you will be taken to the main page of said repository. Here is where you begin the forking and cloning process. There will be a button to fork the repository in the upper right hand corner, which you will need to click. This creates a copy of the repository for you to use. From this point you need to access your command line and use git to clone the repository to your computer for you to use locally.


As far as setting up git and github I didn't really have any issues aside from needing to know the right command line inputs to get git and github synced up together. Git was the more difficult of the two to set up, but even then it just really warranted following the specific instructions within the command line. I learned how both systems function and the neat tools they offer to make file editing and collaboration easier. The combination of these two programs is more facilitative to experimentation, knowing you can easily access an older version of your file if something goes wrong.
