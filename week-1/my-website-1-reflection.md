Creating a repository on github is fairly simple! All you need to do is click the plus in the top right corner of the webpage and select new repository. You will then be taken to a page where you will name the repository, decide whether it will be public or private, and add licenses if need be. From this point you hit create repository and you can begin the cloning process. For cloning, you copy the clone url on the lower right hand side of the repository page. Then you open your comamnd line (find it in the search bar if you don't see it) and input the command "git clone 'url'" replacing 'url' with the copied clone url from the last step. Then hit enter or return and it's done.

Open source means that a particular project is open for anyone to edit and contribute their work to. All the project files are available for anyone to utilize. Changes each person makes are listed separately. Open source allows complete freedom and has no real restrictions.

Open source sounds like a double edged sword. On one hand, it encourages collaboration and harmony, but on the other anyone can access and take your work at any point. It makes me more nervous than anything knowing that anything can happen in an open source scenario.

Licensing means that improvements must be shared just as the original version was. It has the benefits of open source, and it has the addition of preventing negative situations like someone stealing your work.

This section solidified the ideas of cloning, branching, and merging. I feel much more comfortable with them than I did in exercise 1.5, but overall the process is still very new and foreign to me.

I found a resource on deleting branches and merging them to the master that really helped me.
