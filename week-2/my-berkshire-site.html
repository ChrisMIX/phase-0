<!--

  What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

  It was really cool to see the practical applications of my knowledge come to play right after learning these new things.

  How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  There was a bit of a learning curve using these elements at first, but the syntax is fairly similar with each new tool. That helped to lessen the load a bit with each new thing learned.



  How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  It can get a bit tedious and you definitely are tempted to format to create the webpage, but you have to understand the limits of HTML and what its prime uses are. Knowing the strengths and weaknesses of what you are working with is important.

  What seems good and bad about HTML?
  The good things about HTML come from making it fairly straightforward to build websites and basic structure. Each concept has pretty similar structure to it, which helps prevent confusion. The bad is in how tedious it can be to type similar syntax over and over.

  What tricks do you have for remembering how to write html?
  The best tricks for me are keeping a cheat sheet handy, and considering the syntax to be similar to a letter. Like a letter, HTML code has a head, title, body, paragraphs, and lists as well as other things. There are inherent differences between the two things, but for the most part the comparison holds up.
