**What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?**

The purpose of my site is to allow potential employers and colleagues to get to know me better. My aim is to provide a straightforward way to list my thoughts, accomplishments, contact information, and other up to date things about me. My site will feature a blog, my previous work experience, links to my social media platforms, and resume.

**What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?**

My target audience's interests are finding capable people to network with and hire for work purposes. I see my site addressing them in a manner that is very quick, easy, and to the point. Overall I would want users to have a very streamlined experience.

**What is the primary action the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's okay to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.**

The primary actions of the user would be to both view my portfolio, and ideally contact me for more. Honestly I think of it as part of the jounrney to reach me, and not as much the final destination.

**What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?**

Regarding design and user experience, people should know that the experience should be straightforward, clean, and to the point. Honestly if the website confuses people or has too many things going on, they may leave and never come back. People need a clear path guiding them to where you want them to go. As a result, the design needs to have no secrets or learning curve. It should inherently be intuitive.

**What is user experience design and why is it valuable?**

User experience design has you enhancing the satisfaction of the everyday user through improving the usability, accessiblity, and pleasure in the user's experience with your site. It is valuable because it is the only thing that will keep someone from leaving with a bad taste in their mouth. It leaves a good impression and sets the standard for your capabilities and personality as a worker.

**Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?**

I did not find anything to be tedious persay, but using markdown did take a few tries to get right. Trying to figure out the path information and correct syntax took a little bit of experimentation.
